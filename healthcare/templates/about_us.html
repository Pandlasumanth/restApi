                eHealth (also written e-health) is a relatively recent healthcare practice
                supported by electronic processes and communication, dating back to at least 1999.[1] Usage of the term varies. A study in 2005 found 51 unique definitions.[2] Some argue that it is interchangeable with health informatics with a broad definition covering electronic/digital processes in health[3] while others use it in the narrower sense of healthcare practice using the Internet.[4][5][6] It can also include health applications and links on mobile phones, referred to as mHealth or m-Health.[7] Since about 2011, the increasing recognition of the need for better cyber-security and regulation may result in the need
                for these specialized resources to develop safer eHealth solutions that can withstand these growing threats.
